# Apply Random Forest to Classify House Loan Workflow  

## 1. Background and Target
Financial organizations need to decide if it is risky to loan money to someone.
They can use supervized machine learning models like Random Forest(RF) to do this classification task.
Input data: features, like people's demographics(gender, age..), band credits, education etc.
Output data: classification classes(Y, N)

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Financial organizations need to decide if it is risky to loan money to someone.
They can use supervized machine learning models like Random Forest(RF) to do this classification task.
Input data: features, like people's demographics(gender, age..), band credits, education etc.
Output data: classification classes(Y, N)
